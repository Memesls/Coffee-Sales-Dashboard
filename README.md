# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard

This is a sales dashboard for a coffee business created in Excel.

The raw data included 3 tables:

- Orders
- Customers
- Products

Steps I took to create the dashboard in Excel:

1. Clean and format the data
2. Pull information from the Customers and Products table to the Orders table using formulas
3. Create Pivot tables to analyze data dynamically
4. Generate Graphs for all the Pivot tables created
5. Insert a timeline and slicers to filter through the generated reports
6. Assemble/order everything in a single sheet
